# Accessible Design Co.

## Overview
Accessible Design Co. is a fictitious company dedicated to creating inclusive and accessible web designs. This project showcases a responsive multi-section webpage that highlights the company's mission, services, and contact information. The webpage is built with semantic HTML, ensuring that it is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: Contains the semantic HTML structure for the webpage, including sections for the header, main content (hero, about us, services, and contact form), and footer. The navigation bar is implemented with appropriate ARIA roles for accessibility.
  
- **css/style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the webpage. It implements responsive design using Flexbox for the navigation bar and CSS Grid for the services section. Media queries are included to adjust the layout and font sizes for different screen sizes. The styles ensure sufficient color contrast and include focus states for interactive elements.

- **js/main.js**: Intended for any JavaScript functionality needed for the webpage, such as form validation or dynamic content updates. It can also include event listeners for interactive elements.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the webpage.
3. For development, you can modify the CSS in `css/style.css` and the JavaScript in `js/main.js` as needed.

## Design and Development Notes
- The design prioritizes accessibility, ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly.
- The layout is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes using Flexbox and CSS Grid.

## Future Improvements

- Expand the services section with more detailed descriptions and visuals.
- Consider adding a blog or resources section to provide valuable content to users.
